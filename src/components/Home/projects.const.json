    "description": "I'm a big fan of Tim Ferris and his work. Perticularly The 4 Hour Workweek. This is a companion app that I made to be able to follow along better with the book. It features a very costumized todo list, a dreamline planner, pomodoro timer and other concepts from the book. I built this app for offline use with React, Redux and Electron."

    "description": "Wingplan is an itinerary marketplace I worked on for a few months. This was my first React / Redux project. I built it all from the ground up using Node with Express for the backend, Redis for sessions and MongoDB for all other data. I integrated some third party services into the app like AWS S3 and Google Maps. The front-end primarily uses bootstrap for all styling but I built up a basic understanding of Sketch to make some nice custom components for some of the pages. This site and repo are no longer in my control so I can't garuentee it's up or running properly."
